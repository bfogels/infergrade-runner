# InferGrade Runner

InferGrade Runner is the open execution engine for InferGrade.

It is responsible for:

- resolving deployable model artifacts
- executing container-backed benchmark runs locally or in cloud-hosted worker environments
- capturing deployment telemetry and capability evidence
- writing reproducible run bundles that can be uploaded to InferGrade Hub

## Repo Layout

- `python/runner-core`: CLI, bundle orchestration, adapters, transport, and tests
- `containers`: runtime and capability benchmark images
- `schemas`: shared bundle, request, and result contracts
- `docs`: runner-facing architecture and benchmark docs
- `third_party`: vendored benchmark assets used in container builds

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e ./python/runner-core
infergrade --help
```

Run the runner test suite:

```bash
./scripts/test_all.sh
```

## Key Docs

- [Runner vs Hub](docs/runner_vs_hub.md)
- [Contract Ownership](docs/contract_ownership.md)
- [Input/Output Spec](docs/input_output_spec_v0.1.md)
- [Schema Draft](docs/schema_draft.md)
- [Capability Benchmarks](docs/capability_benchmarks.md)

## Relationship To InferGrade Hub

InferGrade Runner is designed to work with the hosted InferGrade Hub, but it remains the open, portable execution surface for the project.

The Hub owns identity, recommendations, community evidence, publishing, and hosted run planning.
The Runner owns the ontology, schemas, and emitted bundle contract.

## Contract Export

Runner publishes the InferGrade execution contract.

Export a versioned contract bundle with:

```bash
python ./scripts/export_contract_bundle.py
```

That bundle is the artifact the Hub should pin to over time.
